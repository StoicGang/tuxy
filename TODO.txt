Imminent:

  * Add more jokes, like around 100. Wanted
  * Interact with the package manager to allow for search and installation from Tuxy. If specific support is needed, start with Flatpak and flathub. Wanted
  * Fix bug in system info callback. Needed
  * Make different GitHub branches for more installation types to support more operating systems (eg, Makefile, CMake, install.sh, Windows Wizard). Needed
  * Create a website and wiki to explain the project and how to use it. Needed (This will come in the next update v0.0.2 pre-alpha)

Future features:

  * Text formatting and general office help.
  * System customization (Not sure how to do this on Windows/Mac, this feature is more intended for Linux)
  * Notes, Node-based task management, and other utilities.
